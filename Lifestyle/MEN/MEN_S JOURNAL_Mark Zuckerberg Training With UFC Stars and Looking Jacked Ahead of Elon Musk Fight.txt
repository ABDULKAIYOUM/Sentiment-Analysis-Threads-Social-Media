Zuckerberg was sporting a six-pack and ripped pecs and arms while training with UFC stars.

It would appear that Mark Zuckerberg isn't taking his upcoming cage match with Elon Musk lightly. Not only is the Facebook founder training with some of UFC's biggest stars to prepare for the fight, but he's looking absolutely ripped to boot.

According to TMZ, MMA champions Israel Adesanya and Alex Volkanovski flew out to Zuckerberg's Northern California home following the UFC 290 showcase in Las Vegas on Saturday night. Once there, the pair quickly got down to it, training the 39-year-old for the match.

Adesanya likewise shared behind-the-scenes photos from the training session on Instagram. Going by the photos, it's abundantly clear that Zuck has already been on a strict fitness regimen on his own, sporting a six-pack and ripped pecs and arms.

"It's an honor to train with you guys!" he commented on the post.


Whether or not this dissuades Musk from the upcoming fight remains to be seen. The 52-year-old billionaire talks a lot of smack on his $44 billion echo chamber, and likely wasn't expecting Zuckerberg to accept when he initially challenged him to a cage match last month. 

However, Zuckerberg, who recently won gold and silver medals at his first jiu-jitsu tournament back in May, quickly accepted. Now, both men are apparently dead serious about the fight, and have reportedly even fielded an offer from the Colosseum in Rome as a location for it all to go down.

Leading up to the match, the date of which is still TBD, diplomacy between the two billionaires has only continued to deteriorate. Since the launch of Meta's Twitter rival platform Threads, the pair have escalated their sniping at one other on social media.

Which is all to say that if this fight does go down, it should definitely be entertaining, to say the least.
