New social-networking apps rivaling Twitter seem to be emerging almost every day, and it's taking its toll on workers in the industry.

With the launch of Meta's Threads and Black Twitter's migration to the Spill app, social media managers say they're overwhelmed by all the new platforms. And they're airing their grievances about their growing workload in the only way they know how — by making memes.
Some are blaming Elon Musk for Twitter's falling popularity among both users and advertisers.

Earlier this month, Musk announced the platform would limit how many tweets each user could see a day. The move wasn't well received, and it led to many searching for alternative social sites.

For social media managers, this means developing a presence on new apps outside of Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok.
Threads — which Twitter cofounder Jack Dorsey dubbed one of "seven Twitter clones" — opened for business on Wednesday night and now has more than 80 million users, per one tracker.

"Lighting a candle for all the social media managers who are panic-writing the team (Thread) strategy tonight," one Twitter user wrote about Meta's new platform.

Guillaume Huin, the head of social media at McDonald's, expressed his own frustrations with a meme featuring actor Pedro Pascal.
"I love to suffer," Huin said in a follow-up tweet.

But Threads has received pushback from new users who say they aren't able to delete their account without also deleting their Instagram (a problem that could soon be fixed), and Spill only available to those with an invite code.

So while it's not certain whether any app will be able to dethrone Twitter, social media managers are say they're doing their best to keep up.
