title=Bored of Threads already? Here’s how you can delete your account
body=Over 30 million people have reportedly already signed up to Threads, Meta’s rival to Twitter which launched earlier this week.
The app, which went live at midnight UK time on Thursday, is linked to Instagram, allowing users to easily set up accounts and gain followers – but it’s already ruffled feathers at Twitter, who have threatened legal action against the company.
While the app has already proven popular, it still has only a fraction of the 350m who are signed up to Twitter.

How can you delete your Threads account?
If you’re thinking of deleting your Threads account already, we’ve got some bad news for you – as it stands, you cannot delete it.
The only way you can delete your account is by deleting your Instagram account too.
If you really don’t want to use Threads, however, you can deactivate your account, as Adam Mosseri, Head of Instagram, explained.
’ve been getting some questions about deleting your account,’ he wrote in a post to the photo-sharing platform.
‘To clarify, you can deactivate your Threads account, which hides your Threads profile and content, you can set your profile to private, and you can delete individual threads posts – all without deleting your Instagram account.
‘Threads is powered by Instagram, so right now it’s just one account, but we’re looking into a way to delete your Threads account separately.’
How to deactivate your Threads account
If you want to deactivate Threads then you can take the following steps:
Go to your profile in the Threads app and click on the ‘double dash’ icon in the top right-hand corner
