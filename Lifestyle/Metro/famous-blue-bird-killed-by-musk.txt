title=Twitter’s new X logo revealed as Elon Musk kills the famous blue bird
body=The Twitter bird’s days are numbered after Elon Musk unveiled the company’s new ‘X’ logo.
Mr Musk bought the social media company in October for $44 billion, and in April an email sent to the organisation’s business partners said it had been renamed X Corp, but would continue to operate as Twitter.
However, in a tweet posted on Sunday morning he said: ‘And soon we shall bid adieu to the twitter [sic] brand and, gradually, all the birds.’
A second post quickly followed, adding: ‘If a good enough X logo is posted tonight, we’ll make go live [sic] worldwide tomorrow.’
On Sunday evening the domain x.com went live and redirected to twitter.com. and shortly after the new logo was projected onto the company’s San Francisco headquarters.
The company’s own Twitter account sports the new X logo and name, and by mid-morning UK time the entire site have been updated to reflect the new look.
A blue bird has been the face of Twitter since its launch in 2006, quickly earning it the nickname ‘the bird app’. There have been four iterations of the logo itself, the first three of which were known as ‘Larry the Bird’, named after Boston Celtics basketball player Larry T Bird. The current version is simply the ‘Twitter bird’.
In April Mr Musk briefly changed the logo to the infamous ‘dogecoin meme’. Shortly after he declared in a BBC interview that his dog Floki, a shiba inu like the dogecoin cryptocurrency logo, was the new Twitter CEO.
The move is the latest in a series of major alterations to Twitter since Mr Musk’s takeover, including the ‘verified’ blue tick status being monetised and a temporary limit at the start of July on the number of posts users were allowed to read.
