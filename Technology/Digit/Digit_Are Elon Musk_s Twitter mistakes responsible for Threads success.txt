Twitter isn't as popular as it used to be. For real. The microblogging platform has come down to 37th rank in domain ranking according to Domain Name System rankings data from Cloudflare. Besides that, Meta has launched a new microblogging platform, Threads, which competes with Twitter and it has gained 100 million users in just over two days which directly hit Twitter where it hurts most.

So why are people leaving Twitter and joining Threads? Is it because of changes on Twitter? Let’s find out.

Changes in Twitter which divert users to Threads
Elon Musk removed the Legacy Verification from Twitter in April 2023 and switched to paid verifications, which didn’t get much love from users. Those who are worth the blue tick should also pay for it and those who don’t can get their accounts verified very easily now. This has directly attacked the authentication of Twitter.On the other hand, Meta is also offering paid verifications on Instagram but it hasn’t removed the Legacy Verifications yet. Those who got the blue tick because of their content, still have blue tick without paying any dime.Another bad move Elon made on Twitter is that he set a limit for the tweets to unpaid and paid accounts. If you are not paying Twitter for the verification then you can only read 600 tweets in a day. However, if a user is paying Twitter for the verification, then the limit of tweets in a day is 6000.

At this rate, will Twitter's fall in popularity should squarely be blamed on Elon Musk? What do you think? Let us know in the comments below
