Meta’s new microblogging platform, Threads has been a big hit all over the globe, having 100 million users in over two days. After the launch of Threads, Twitter saw a downfall in the users as the Meta’s new microblogging platform attracted Twitter’s users. One of many reasons why people joined Threads is that, when Elon Musk took the charge on Twitter, he made some changes like removing Legacy verification which directly attacked the genuineness of Twitter. Threads also offers paid verification but it still has the Legacy Verification. 

But just like that variation, Twitter has some features that Threads doesn’t have which can be an annoying thing for a user. Here are five of them:No web versionTwitter can be used both on web and on app but Threads needs to be downloaded from the app store. You cannot use it on the web which could be a problem for people who don't have enough storage in their smartphones.

No DM option
In Threads, if you want to talk to someone you have to do it openly because there is no DM option. So either you talk in comments or through threads. 
No embedded threads links
If you liked something and want to embed a thread in your article or blog. Unfortunately, you cannot do that because Threads doesn’t give you an option to embed threads links. 
No Spaces
Threads does not have this cool feature called Spaces in Twitter. Spaces is basically a live podcast on Twitter where you can join the group and talk vocally. 
No Communities
Threads also doesn’t have groups like Twitter's Community. Communities basically refers to groups of users just like any other social media i.e. Instagram, Whatsapp and much more.

Given the lack of these convenience and content-related features, it is no surprise that Threads is already seeing a downfall in the number of active users. However, given Twitter’s uncertain future, it won’t be surprising to see some of the above-mentioned features making their way to the new Meta platform in the future.
