Though the “X” takeover has not yet begun, Musk did share a fanmade video — posted in response to his request for a “good enough X logo” — that shows the current Twitter logo becoming an “X” in a flashy, dramatic transition. The company’s current logo, simply called the Twitter Bird, has gone through a metamorphosis since the Twitter’s 2006 launch, as detailed in The New York Times’ article titled “Who Made That Twitter Bird?”   On Sunday morning, Musk joked about his obvious affinity for the letter "X," tweeting, “Not sure what subtle clues gave it [away], but I like the letter X,” alongside a photo of himself making an “X” with his arms in front of a wall covered in the letter.   The Twitter owner also shared a photo of a black iteration of the current app logo and wrote, “Like this but X.”  “To embody the imperfections in us all that make us unique,” he added of the design concept.   “Twitter is the bird, the bird is Twitter,” Bowman said during the redesign's introduction, per the NYT, adding that it is “the ultimate representation of freedom, hope and limitless possibility.”
