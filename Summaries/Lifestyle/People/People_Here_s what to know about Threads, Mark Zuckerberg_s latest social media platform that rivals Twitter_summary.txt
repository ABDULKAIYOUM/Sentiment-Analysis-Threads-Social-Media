A downside to the Threads Instagram integration, according to the app's Supplemental Privacy Policy, is that users can not delete their Threads accounts without completely deleting their Instagram accounts.   On July 5, Meta — the parent company of Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp — launched Threads, a new conversation-based app nearly identical to the format of Twitter.   Zuckerberg — who's already racked up over 1 million Threads followers less than 24 hours after its launch — has engaged with users on the platform, answering questions and sharing updates on his plan for the app moving forward.   Furthermore, the algorithm-driven timeline also includes posts created by accounts that users don't follow — similar to Twitter's “For You” tab, an alternate timeline that's separate from users' main feed solely featuring accounts they follow.   Threads' link to Instagram is a benefit in comparison to Twitter, allowing users' settings to sync up directly to the new platform.
