Unlike big-box competitors such as Walmart, Amazon, Target, or Home Depot, Costco's investment in boosting its social media presence and streamlining its ecommerce operations has remained comparatively minuscule.   Costco's Instagram page meanwhile has over 1.3 million followers and posts about once per day with a mix of family-friendly memes and cute snapshots of kids and pets showing the Costco lifestyle. Indeed, all but one of the ten largest retailers, including Walmart and Kroger, have already activated their accounts â€” a process as simple as downloading the Threads app and logging in via an existing Instagram account.   Costco execs know the real money comes from two things: getting people to sign up for paid memberships and getting those members to come into the warehouse where they buy a lot more stuff than they were planning to.   That's about half of what Walmart reports percentage-wise for its US sales "related to eCommerce," and far below Target's 17% of "digitally originated" sales, per the respective companies' earnings statements.
