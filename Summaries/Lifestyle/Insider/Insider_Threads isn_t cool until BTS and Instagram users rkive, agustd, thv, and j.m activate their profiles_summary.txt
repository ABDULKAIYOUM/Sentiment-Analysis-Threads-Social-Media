This writer — a card-carrying member of the BTS ARMY — has been waiting for hours for just one member of the boyband to sign up.   And the band's youngest, Jungkook, deactivated his Instagram account a while back and barely used the app, to begin with, and having an Instagram app is essential to make the leap to Threads.   But at press time, no one pulled the trigger and tried "Threading" their thoughts on Threads.   RM, Suga, V, and Jimin are still active on Instagram.   That pain has somewhat been assuaged by the fun posts on Threads from Sam Riegel, Marisha Ray, and Liam O'Brien — cast members of Critical Role, a top Twitch stream this writer is also a big fan of. Suga's been active on the platform too under the handle agustd, his stage name, blessing the BTS ARMY with post after post about his D-DAY world tour.
