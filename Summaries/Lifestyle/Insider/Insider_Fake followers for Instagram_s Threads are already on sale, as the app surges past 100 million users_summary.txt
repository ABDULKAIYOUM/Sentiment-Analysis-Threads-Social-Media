From an offer of $7.50 for 100 followers, to $1,900 for 50,000 followers on Instagram's Threads app, paid engagement services and bot farms are pouncing on a new market, according to a review of a handful of sites by Insider.   HypeAuditor defines suspicious accounts as any Instagram page that appear to be bots or "use specific services for likes, comments, and followers," the company told Insider.   "We do rank posts lightly and show recommendations (posts from accounts you don't follow) in feed, which is particularly important for a new app before people follow enough accounts," head of Instagram Adam Mosseri wrote in a recent Thread reply.   "Help us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their consent," Instagram's community guidelines page reads. While the follower count metric still holds some weight, especially when it comes to securing and negotiating brand deals as an influencer, it isn't so clear how important follower count will be for Threads.
