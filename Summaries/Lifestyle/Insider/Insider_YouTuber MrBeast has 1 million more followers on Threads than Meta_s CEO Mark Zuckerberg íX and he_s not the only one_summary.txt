Though the app is not currently available for use on desktop, users' profiles are accessible to view on the website, which appears to round the numbers to the nearest million, showing 4 million followers for Donaldson and 3 million for Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg has 2.7 million followers as of July 10, while Donaldson has 4.1 million, according to their follower accounts displayed on the mobile version of the app.   It received 10 million sign-ups in its first seven hours of launching, according to a post on the platform by Mark Zuckerberg, and now has more than 100 million users, reaching the milestone even faster than OpenAI's ChatGPT, according to estimates from data tracking platform Quiver Quantitative. Gomez, for example, is the third most-followed individual on Instagram, behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi (neither of whom have Threads accounts at the time of writing), with 420 million followers, according to the analytics website Socialtracker.    The YouTuber, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, became the first person to hit 1 million Threads followers on July 6 at around 9:42 a.m. EST, according to a post from Guinness World Records.
