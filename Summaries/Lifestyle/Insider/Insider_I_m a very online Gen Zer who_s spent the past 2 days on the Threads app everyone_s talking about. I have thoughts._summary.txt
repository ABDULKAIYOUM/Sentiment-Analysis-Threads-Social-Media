Since Threads accounts are linked to Instagram profiles, I was curious to see whether people would be trying to post similar content on Threads as they would on Instagram.   Whenever I've been on Twitter lately, my feed has mainly been saturated with people commentating on celebrity controversies, arguing about their opinions on the future of Twitter, or sharing dark humor and jokes that are typically at the expense of others, so I haven't been hating my experience scrolling on Threads so far.    I write about online communities and social media trends at Insider, and the buzz around the emergence of Threads, a text posts app that has been described as a rival to Twitter, was bound to be something I was going to be reporting on â€” so I downloaded it.    After asking around on a few group chats, I found out that people I know who are very interested in keeping up to date with trends made accounts to stay in the loop, but other friends, particularly those who do not already have a Twitter account, don't really care about the launch of Threads and don't want to get involved.   The Threads community is still maturing in its understanding of the app but overall it's very wholesome  While I have a Twitter account, I must say I'm rather reluctant to post there.
