Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, posted on Threads that the app would not “encourage” news, as Twitter once did: “There are more than enough amazing communities—sports, music, fashion, beauty, entertainment, etc.—to make a vibrant platform without needing to get into politics or hard news,” he wrote. Threads’ feed is algorithmic, similar to TikTok and Twitter’s “For You” feed, meaning that automated recommendations pop up as often as posts from the accounts that you follow. As a result, much of what I see on Threads is the kind of banal celebrity and brand self-promotion that I tried to avoid on Twitter—posts from Chris Hemsworth and Ellen DeGeneres, Spotify asking fans for their favorite playlists, and suggestions to follow Kardashians. In his influential newsletter Garbage Day, Ryan Broderick described Threads content as “anti-culture nothingness that does well on Facebook or Instagram.”   On Thursday morning, with a looming sense of dread, I signed up for Threads, a Twitter clone from Meta, the proprietor of Facebook and Instagram.
