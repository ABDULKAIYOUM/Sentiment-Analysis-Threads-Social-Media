You can now take part in a trend colloquially known as “the shuffle”: spend all day on Threads; get fired from job; more time for Threads. Meta’s new Twitter rival, Threads, débuted to wide acclaim, gaining tens of millions of users overnight. Unlike other social-media platforms, Threads boosts your self-esteem by making Likes nearly impossible to receive. Although user numbers remain comparatively low, fans will be able to connect with celebrities in more intimate ways, such as by threatening self-harm if Taylor Swift doesn’t give you free concert tickets. Fake news is impossible to spread on Threads since it’s understood that no one means anything they say.
