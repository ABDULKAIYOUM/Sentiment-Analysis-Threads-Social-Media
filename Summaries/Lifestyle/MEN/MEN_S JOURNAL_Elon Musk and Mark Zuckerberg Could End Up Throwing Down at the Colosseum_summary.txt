The biggest issue is the height and weight disparity, as Musk, 51, stands at six-foot-one and weighs in at over 200 pounds, while Zuckerberg, 39, is five-foot-seven and closer to 150 pounds.   This whole thing started last week when Musk, perturbed at Meta's plans to launch a competitor to Twitter reportedly to be called Threads, facetiously challenged Zuckerberg to a cage match in a tweet. Both Zuckerberg and Musk are reportedly dead serious about the fight.   We can only imagine how much tickets to a Zuckerberg-Musk fight would fetch.   With both Zuckerberg and Musk evidently serious about this fight, the question at this point seems less of if it's going to happen, but when and where.
