"Given the difficulty in protecting a single letter, especially one as popular commercially as 'X,' Twitter's protection is likely to be confined to very similar graphics to their X logo," Douglas Masters, a trademark attorney at law firm Loeb & Loeb, explained. Gerben believes Meta and Microsoft likely wouldn't sue X Corp. unless they feel that Musk's X diminishes the brand equity the companies have established in the letter themselves. This includes tech companies like Meta—a direct X competitor—and Microsoft laying claim to the 24th letter of the alphabet.    Meta, meanwhile, owns a federal trademark registered in 2019 for a blue-and-white letter "X" for industries including software and social media. There's just one problem: the letter "X" has nearly 900 active trademark registrations in the U.S.
