In a compelling turn in the tawdry saga of the Mark Zuckerberg versus Elon Musk cage fight, actor and former MMA fighter Georges St-Pierre has volunteered to train Musk for his day in the ring opposite Meta's CEO.   Chris Cox, Meta's chief product officer, made a dig at Musk's social platform during a company-wide meeting earlier this month when he mentioned conversations with "creators and public figures who are interested in having a platform that is sanely run."   Musk, for his part, told podcaster Joe Rogan last year that he has a background in Kyokushin karate, as well as judo, taekwondo and, conveniently, "Brazilian jiu-jitsu briefly" as a child growing up in South Africa.   St-Pierre, widely considered one of the best MMA fighters in history, cheered on the SpaceX founder and Twitter dismantler, tagging Musk in a Twitter post where he volunteered to get involved in the fight prep.
