The 52-year-old billionaire talks a lot of smack on his $44 billion echo chamber, and likely wasn't expecting Zuckerberg to accept when he initially challenged him to a cage match last month.    Zuckerberg was sporting a six-pack and ripped pecs and arms while training with UFC stars.   Not only is the Facebook founder training with some of UFC's biggest stars to prepare for the fight, but he's looking absolutely ripped to boot.   According to TMZ, MMA champions Israel Adesanya and Alex Volkanovski flew out to Zuckerberg's Northern California home following the UFC 290 showcase in Las Vegas on Saturday night. Going by the photos, it's abundantly clear that Zuck has already been on a strict fitness regimen on his own, sporting a six-pack and ripped pecs and arms.
