In a companywide meeting earlier this month, Meta chief product officer Chris Cox dissed Musk and his social media company, saying that they had been "hearing from creators and public figures who are interested in having a platform that is sanely run."   When another user responded, warning Musk that they heard Zuckerberg "does jiu-jitsu now," Musk replied, "I'm up for a cage match if he is."    Responding to the SpaceX founder on his Instagram story on Wednesday evening, Zuck screenshot Musk's tweet, writing a succinct: "Send me location."   Doing what he evidently does best, Musk took to trolling Zuckerberg earlier this week, responding to a Twitter thread about Meta's forthcoming competitor to the platform, which will reportedly be called "Threads." But one also has to imagine that Musk hasn't engaged in hand-to-hand combat in quite some time, depending how accurate that story was in the first place.
