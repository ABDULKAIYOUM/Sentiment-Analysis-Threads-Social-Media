Threads is not a place for news, politics, or anything interesting In an interview with The Verge, Adam Mosseri, Instagram’s boss, said that Threads is “not going to do anything to encourage” politics and “hard news.” Installing Threads won’t necessarily give it access to your health data, purchase history, or locations, but if you end up sharing that information via the Threads app, Meta can use it to link that information to you. If you’re using the latest version of Android, you can disable some of the data access, but still, Threads will collect things like your purchase history, browsing history, your unique user identifying information, and store it all on its servers for ads across its platforms. When you first open the app, even after following a lot of people, it’s going to feed you its algorithm and show you “popular” or “engaging” posts—not posts from people you follow. You can’t escape the influencers This is more of a “feel” than something tangible, but since the app isn’t focused on news, politics, real-time updates, or promoting communities, the result is a text-based Instagram app.
