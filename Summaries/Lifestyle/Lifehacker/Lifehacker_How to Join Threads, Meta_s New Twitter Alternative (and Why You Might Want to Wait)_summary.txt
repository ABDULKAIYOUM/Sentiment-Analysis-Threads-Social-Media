Deleting your Threads account means deleting your Instagram too If that concerns you, I recommend skipping Threads for now—especially since the only way to delete your Threads account is by deleting your Instagram account too. So while you’ll have to deal with the possibility your Facebook and Instagram-loving relatives could find and follow you on Threads, it is certainly the easiest of the new Twitter replacements to join right now—as long as you’re cool with some of the app’s questionable privacy practices.   Deactivate Profile and remove the app from your phone, your account will still exist until you completely delete Instagram as well—so make sure you really want to use Threads before signing up. How to join and use Threads To sign up for Threads, you first need an Instagram account. While you can limit some data collection in your Instagram account settings or your phone’s permissions, certain data collection is required to use Threads.
