The feud between Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter owner Elon Musk heated up on Wednesday after Meta officially launched its Twitter-like competition, a new platform called Threads.   Threads posts have 500-character limits — Tweets have a 280-character limit, except for those who pay for Twitter Blue, the platform's premium version — and can contain text, photos, and videos.   Upon the launch, Musk decided to take subtle jabs at the platform by laugh-reacting to several Tweets that made fun of Threads, including one that referred to Threads as a "special hell."   The app, which gives users the ability to sync followers and profile information from their Instagram profiles, had over 30 million users sign up just one day after it launched, per Engadget.   Zuckerberg also took to Twitter to post a meme, his first time actively using the platform in over a decade.
