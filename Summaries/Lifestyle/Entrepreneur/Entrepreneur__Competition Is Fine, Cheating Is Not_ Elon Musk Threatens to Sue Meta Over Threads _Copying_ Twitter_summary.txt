A letter written by Twitter's lawyer, Alex Spiro, accused Meta and Threads of using "trade secrets" by hiring dozens of ex-Twitter employees to help build and roll out the new platform, calling it a "copycat" of Twitter's original platform.   The battle between Mark Zuckerberg's Threads and Elon Musk's Twitter is heating up â€” Twitter is threatening to sue Meta for "systematic, willful, and unlawful misappropriation of Twitter's trade secrets and other intellectual property."   "Twitter reserves all rights, including, but not limited to, the right to seek both civil remedies and injunctive relief without further notice to prevent any further retention, disclosure, or use of its intellectual property by Meta," the letter reads.   Andy Stone, director of communications at Meta, addressed the letter in a Thread and denied allegations that the company was hiring former Twitter employees, saying it was "not a thing."   Threads, which has already garnered over 30 million subscribers, has been called a "Twitter copycat" or a "Twitter killer," depending on who you ask.
