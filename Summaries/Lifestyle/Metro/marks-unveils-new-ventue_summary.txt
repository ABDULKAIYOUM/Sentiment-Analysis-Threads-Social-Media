Speaking to Tucker Carlson on Fox News in April, Mr Musk said he was worried AI models were being trained to be ‘politically correct’, and in response pledged to launch his own chatbot, ‘Truth GPT’. Mr Musk, who is also CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, reportedly bought around 10,000 of the graphics processing units required to develop advanced AI systems earlier this year in his bid to compete with OpenAI, the company he founded alongside current CEO Sam Altman. A brief statement on the company’s website reveals little else about the company, based in the San Francisco Bay Area, but noted a ‘meet the team’ Twitter Spaces chat taking place tomorrow. Mr Musk did not sign a recent statement by the Centre for AI safety calling for mitigation of the risk of extinction from AI to be ranked a priority alongside pandemics and nuclear.
