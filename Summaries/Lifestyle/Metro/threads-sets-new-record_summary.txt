After the initial announcement, social media users touted Threads as a ‘Twitter killer’, with growing discontent on the bird app. Unlike other apps, Threads had the advantage of nearly 2.35 billion monthly active Instagram users nudged towards the new app. On Sunday, responding to a screenshot of a Threads conversation between Mr Zuckerberg and the account of fast food joint Wendy’s, the Tesla chief said ‘Zuck is a cuck’, an insult often used to attack the masculinity of an opponent. While it’s early days for Threads, the current user count isn’t likely to go down as Threads profiles can’t be deleted without deleting your entire Instagram account.
