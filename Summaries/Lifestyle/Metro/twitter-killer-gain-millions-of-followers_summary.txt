After the initial announcement, social media users touted Threads to be a ‘Twitter killer’, with the growing discontent on the bird app. Unlike other potential Twitter alternatives like Mastodon, Bluesky or Hive, Threads has the advantage of nearly 2.35 billion monthly active Instagram users who will be nudged towards the new app. Mr Zuckerberg only announced the new app on Tuesday, calling it an app built for ‘sharing with text’. ‘Threads offers a new, separate space for real-time updates and public conversations,’ said Mr Zuckerberg in an announcement.
