The move is the latest in a series of major alterations to Twitter since Mr Musk’s takeover, including the ‘verified’ blue tick status being monetised and a temporary limit at the start of July on the number of posts users were allowed to read. A blue bird has been the face of Twitter since its launch in 2006, quickly earning it the nickname ‘the bird app’. The company’s own Twitter account sports the new X logo and name, and by mid-morning UK time the entire site have been updated to reflect the new look. There have been four iterations of the logo itself, the first three of which were known as ‘Larry the Bird’, named after Boston Celtics basketball player Larry T Bird.
