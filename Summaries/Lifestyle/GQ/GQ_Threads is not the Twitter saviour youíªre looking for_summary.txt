(This is Twitter Blue’s fundamental flaw: while TikTok, Youtube and Instagram understand that the value of social media comes from the creativity of its power users, Musk seems to think that what people value is Twitter itself.)   This morning, Meta – the social media app whose greatest hits include the democracy-threatening nightmare that is Facebook and the world’s most expensive game of Second Life – launched Threads, its wholesale rip-off of Twitter. What’s more, the kind of people who were never on Twitter but were on Instagram – hundreds of millions of people – can easily carry their audience to Threads. Before we all embrace yet another place to shitpost away our boredom, let’s take a moment to marinate in the fact that somehow our lord and saviour of social media in 2023 is the same company it feels like just yesterday was being hailed by its own former employees as a threat to democracy; one that has been fined billions for illegally harvesting user data; that is in a dispute with an entire continent over flagrant breaches of EU laws; and whose past list of sins range from allegations of massive tax avoidance to allegedly enabling the organisation of an actual genocide.   The one winner from Musk’s midlife crisis might be Zuckerberg, a man whose catastrophic leadership at Meta of late recently led to it laying off 11,000 workers; last year Meta’s VR arm alone lost more than twice as much money than Twitter makes in annual revenue.
