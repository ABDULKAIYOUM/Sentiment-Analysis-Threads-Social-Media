The latest gaff came over the weekend, when Musk announced a “temporary” limitation on the amount of tweets one can view in a day — 6,000 for the Verifieds, 600 for the (cooler) Plebs, since bumped up to 10,000 and 1,000 respectively — to “address extreme levels of data scraping and system manipulation”. Post-Musk, with the Legacy Verifieds — those who were anointed before it became a monthly prescription — stripped of their medals, it has become a grand statement of virtue to snub it.   Jargon aside, the effect was immediate and obvious: the Extremely Online begged for invites to exclusive rival platform Bluesky like Titanic passengers jostling for space on lifeboats, and a renewed flurry of hashtags apocalyptically declared the end of Twitter as we know it.   Yes, Twitter has become an integral part of the digital ecosystem, providing a platform for malnourished culture journalists and European sex bots alike to hock their wares, or a way to speak truth to power by way of becoming Ron DeSantis’ number-one reply guy. In truth we should be taking our sheer horror at all of this as a warning sign that, yes, we are posting too much, and maybe an intervention — even an unintended one — is what we need.
