It recently overtook ChatGPT as the fastest-growing app of all time and within two hours of the app’s availability last week, Threads experienced two million sign ups before reaching 10 million by the end of the day. His new CEO has purportedly been installed to steady the ship, with little promise of this, but Threads’ epic success with new users could unseat the 17-year-old Twitter from its reign. Twitter apparently has around 350 million regular users, so it’s not a surprise that Elon Musk is bristling at a rival making such a successful debut, especially since he only acquired the company in October. According to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the following morning the figure had climbed to 30 million.   There can be no doubt that Threads’ popularity has been aided by its integration with Instagram, which makes it easy for people to set up and add followers.
