This directly targets Twitter’s reputation for being a platform that features a great amount of toxic, hostile behaviour between users, where early adopters of Meta’s alternative, such as Democratic US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, stated on her first post “May this platform have good vibes, strong community, excellent humour and less harassment”. Meta, the parent company for Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, have now launched a new platform named Threads, an app to directly compete with Twitter as a “text based conversation app”. Meta’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, describes Threads to be a “friendlier” alternative to the already well-established and ludicrously popular Twitter, which in recent times has been struggling to retain its users with a series of increasingly unpopular updates.   One major selling point of Threads is its mission to encourage a friendly, safe environment for all kinds of people, where filtering out certain kinds of content that may feature specific key-words or subject matter is made quick and easy, just as it is on Instagram. Threads is directly linked to Instagram, where users can sign up and log in to the new platform with all their already existing details and connections with other people.
