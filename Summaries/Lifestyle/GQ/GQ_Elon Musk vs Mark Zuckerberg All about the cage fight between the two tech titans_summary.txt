Elon Musk vs Mark Zuckerberg: All about the cage fight between the two tech titans  What prompted the cage fight?   According to Semafor, lawyer Alex Sipro, on behalf of Twitter, accused Zuckerberg of getting on board ex-Twitter staff who have “access to Twitter's trade secrets and other highly confidential information.”   Musk, who’s received much flak for changing the platform ever since he took over Twitter last October, responded instantly with: “up for a cage match if he (Zuckerberg) is lol.”   Zuckerberg seems to have struck when the iron was scalding hot; introducing a “sanely run” competitor to Twitter at a time when most users seemed unhappy with its Musk-led revamped version.   When Twitter CEO Elon Musk first threw down the gauntlet; challenging Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to a cage fight, many rolled their eyes at the theatrics between the two tech billionaires.
