You see some really formless scraps – a lot of panting, and grappling, and the quiet squeaking sound of trainers on plastic – but they’re fighting because they have a need to fight, a need to prove something (more to themselves than anyone watching), and every small bout feels more genuine than an all-day press conference preceding a five-round stadium fight where Big John has been hired to turn up and say “bosh”. On the one hand: by all accounts, Mark Zuckerberg is incredibly adept at jiu-jitsu, and also has the blank-behind-the-eyes chilling stare that you only really get with America’s best serial killers, and I would love to see him dismantle Elon Musk – a man I have only ever learned anything about under duress – piece-by-piece, trapped in a cage, while his acolytes watch on in horror. There's also the fact that everything Elon Musk has said for the past ten years has been a strange joke without a punchline – when he says “up for a cage fight”, “Vegas Octagon”, he doesn’t actually know what he’s saying. The – as the website has to stress, “LEGAL” – Washington-based fighting organisation is basically a homemade octagon in someone’s garden and everyone who fights there does so because they started doing a bit of boxing training in the gym eight months ago and have a roaring, ancient, warrior’s need to express that energy somehow. On the other hand: no, I very much don’t want to see Mark Zuckerberg grapple Elon Musk in a cage match, even if he pulls his eyes out, because I am sick of watching people with social cachet disgrace combat sports with slickly boring exhibition matches.
