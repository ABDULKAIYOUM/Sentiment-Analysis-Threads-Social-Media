Jack Sweeney — the 20-year-old Florida college student who started the ElonJet Twitter account that used a bot to track the location of Musk’s private jet using publicly available data — started an account named “elonmusksjet” on Threads last week soon after Meta launched the platform.   But the elonmusksjet account was temporarily blocked, according to a posting on Sweeney’s personal Threads account, which included a screenshot of message he received from Threads telling him the elonmusksjet account was active once again following a requested review.   24-hour delay account Sweeney has continued to tweet the location of Musk’s jet with a 24-hour delay, using the account ElonJetNextDay, though that account has a far more modest 25,600 followers.   The first Threads post on the elonmusksjet account was one announcing that ElonJet had landed on Threads, followed by one asking Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg if the account could stay.   Sweeney told CNN the had a Threads account within hours of when it first became available, because it was easy to set up using his existing Instagram Elon jet account.
