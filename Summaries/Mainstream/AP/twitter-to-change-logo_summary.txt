body=NEW YORK (AP) — Elon Musk said Sunday that he plans to change the logo of Twitter to an “X” from the famous blue bird, marking what would be the latest big change since he bought the social media platform for $44 billion last year. Musk’s move to change Twitter’s logo to an “X” also comes as Twitter faces new competition from Meta’s new app, Threads, launched earlier this month. date_published=11:43 AM GMT, July 23, 2023 published_by=ANNE D’INNOCENZIO title=Musk says Twitter to change logo to “X” from the bird. Yaccarino wrote on Twitter that X would be “the future state of unlimited interactivity – centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking – creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities.” “And soon we shall bid adieu to the twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds,” Musk wrote on his account.
