In a separate Threads post Tuesday, Roth said regarding the update that users “may need to restart your app to see some of these or otherwise wait until the end of the day!”   Cameron Roth, a software engineer for Instagram, shared a Threads post Tuesday, announcing additions to the app as part of an update to Apple’s iOS.   Instagram Threads, the Twitter clone Meta launched two weeks ago, is being updated to include new features, including a follows tab.   Advertisers told CNBC they’re hoping for Threads to incorporate more features such as chronological feeds and the ability to search for hashtags, which could help them create better ad campaigns when Meta opens up that opportunity.   Threads was an instant hit for Meta, which reported a record 100 million sign-ups in just five days, eliciting defensive responses from Twitter founder Elon Musk and new CEO Linda Yaccarino.
