Meta’s new Threads app has been live for less than two days, but one of the company’s top executives thinks prioritizing news and political discourse on the platform “is not at all worth” the apparent business and “platform” downsides.   “Politics and hard news are inevitably going to show up on Threads - they have on Instagram as well to some extent - but we’re not going to do anything to encourage those verticals,” he wrote in a response to a reporter’s question about Threads replacing Twitter for news industry professionals.   Meta representatives did not immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment on whether Meta would downrank news or political content on Threads as the company has periodically done on other platforms.   new legislation would require Meta to pay money to Canadian newsrooms, something that would cost both Google and Meta an estimated $329 million Canadian dollars against billions of advertising revenue.   Mosseri’s comment came even as Meta fights to prevent governments from forcing the company to pay newsrooms for the content that Meta leverages for advertises and engagement.
