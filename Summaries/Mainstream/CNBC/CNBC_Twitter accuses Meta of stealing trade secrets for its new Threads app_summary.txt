The letter from longtime Elon Musk attorney Alex Spiro alleged that Meta’s new Twitter clone was built by former Twitter employees “deliberately assigned” to develop a “copycat” app. Twitter’s lawyer wrote a letter to Facebook parent Meta on Wednesday, accusing the company of “systematic” and “unlawful misappropriation” of trade secrets following the launch of its Threads service.   Spiro said Meta is “expressly prohibited” from crawling or scraping Twitter’s follower data, without providing evidence that Meta has engaged in that activity. “No one on the Threads engineering team is a former Twitter employee,” Andy Stone, Meta communications director, posted on Threads. On Thursday, Twitter’s new CEO Linda Yaccarino tweeted that the company was “often imitated,” a clear reference to Threads.
