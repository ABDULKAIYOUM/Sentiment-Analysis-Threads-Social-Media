Many users were quick to point out that the “For you” and “Following” tabs look similar to the existing layout on Twitter, which is being rebranded to “X” as part of the latest change to the platform since Elon Musk acquired it late last year.   Meta said Tuesday that the Threads update will also allow users to sort their “Activity” feed by follows, quotes and reposts, allow people to see their liked posts in their settings and translate certain posts that appear in a different language.   Threads has been touted by Meta executives such as Mosseri as a more positive “public square” for communities “that never really embraced Twitter.”   Meta’s new text-based social media app Threads launched a highly requested new feature Tuesday: a “Following” tab.   The new tab allows users to see chronological posts from people they follow instead of the less cohesive, algorithmically curated content that appears in the “For you” feed.
