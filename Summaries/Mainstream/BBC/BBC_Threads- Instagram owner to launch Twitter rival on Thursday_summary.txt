"Thank goodness they're so sanely run", Mr Musk responded to a tweet about Threads, in an apparent fresh swipe at Mr Zuckerberg.   Facebook owner Meta is launching its new app to rival Twitter and says it will go live on Thursday.   The move is the latest in a rivalry between Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter owner Elon Musk.   The app, which is called Threads and is available for pre-order on the Apple App Store, will be linked to Instagram.
