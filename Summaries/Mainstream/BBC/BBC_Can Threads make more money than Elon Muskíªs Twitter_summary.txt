After all, Mr Zuckerberg, whose Meta made more than $117bn in sales last year, has a monster track record when it comes to selling adverts - and none of the apparent qualms of Mr Musk, who has disdained advertising at his electric car company, Tesla, and been looking for alternative ways to fund Twitter.   Twitter threatens legal action over Threads app Threads could cause real problems for Twitter 'Almost every influencer will be hopping on Threads' Though the fashion and lifestyle content that is the bread-and-butter of Instagram clearly holds appeal for advertisers, it is not clear the world needs another platform to consume it.   "News hounds and avid Twitter loyalists aren't likely to defect... and Meta will need to keep Threads interesting to maintain the momentum once the novelty wears off," Ms Enberg said, adding that Mr Zuckerberg - who has been skewered before for creating copycat products - has "struggled" with innovation.   But frustration with Twitter has left plenty of people hungry for an alternative; and Meta's promise of a "saner, kinder place" than Twitter "supercharged" early sign-ups, Insider Intelligence analyst Jasmine Enberg said.   Less than 24 hours after Mr Zuckerberg launched his alternative to Twitter, Threads, it had already claimed some 30 million sign-ups - lending it credibility as a serious contender in the world of social media.
