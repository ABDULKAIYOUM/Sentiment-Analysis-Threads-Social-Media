Mark Zuckerberg’s rival to Elon Musk-owned platform has grown rapidly since launch last Wednesday  Mark Zuckerberg’s “Twitter killer” Threads app has reached 100m sign-ups in less than five days.   Twitter has, however, retained the support of the senior Taliban leader Anas Haqqani, who endorsed the app over Meta’s Threads, which he said has an “intolerant policy”.   The Twitter rival has grown rapidly since its launch last Wednesday, with Zuckerberg seeking to woo users with a promise that the platform would focus on “kindness”.   Elon Musk has responded with a threat to sue Meta, the parent company of Threads, over its launch of a “copycat” app.   He added: “The meteoric rise of Threads, in just five days, demonstrates just how many people have longed for an alternative to what Twitter has devolved into.”
