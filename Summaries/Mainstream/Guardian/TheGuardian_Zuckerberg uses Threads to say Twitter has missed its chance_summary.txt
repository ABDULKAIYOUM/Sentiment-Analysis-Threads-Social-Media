US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who threatened to quit Twitter in May after Musk promoted a “sick” impersonator account, used her new Threads account to write: “May this platform have good vibes, strong community, excellent humor, and less harassment.”   Meta founder says rival platform will ‘focus on kindness’ as it claims 30 million users within day of launch  Mark Zuckerberg has taken a swipe at Elon Musk’s Twitter as his competitor to the platform, Threads, reached 30m sign-ups less than 24 hours after launching.   Musk, who has more than 146 million followers on Twitter, did not tweet about Threads directly on Thursday, although he appeared to dismiss the “friendly” approach, tweeting: “It is definitely preferable to be attacked by strangers on Twitter, than indulge in the false happiness of hide-the-pain Instagram”. The chief executive and founder of Meta used his new Threads account to say Twitter had not “nailed” its opportunity to become a mega app and implied that it had underachieved because of the amount of hostility on the microblogging platform.   Threads closely resembles Twitter visually, although some of the wording has been changed, with retweets called “reposts” and tweets called “threads”.
