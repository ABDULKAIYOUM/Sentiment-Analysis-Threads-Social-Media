To address extreme levels of data scraping & system manipulation, we’ve applied the following temporary limits:  - Verified accounts are limited to reading 6000 posts/day - Unverified accounts to 600 posts/day - New unverified accounts to 300/day  8. Threads support up to 5-minute long videos while Twitter lets you post only 2-minute 20-second videos.   Threads allow for 500 character count while Twitter lets you write only until you hit 280 characters.   You have to tap enter thrice to start a line of threads on Instagram Threads. It’s the day after Instagram Threads debuted and the microblogging app has already soared to the top of the app store charts.
