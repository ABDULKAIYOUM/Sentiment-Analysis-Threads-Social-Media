Changes in Twitter which divert users to Threads Elon Musk removed the Legacy Verification from Twitter in April 2023 and switched to paid verifications, which didnâ€™t get much love from users. Besides that, Meta has launched a new microblogging platform, Threads, which competes with Twitter and it has gained 100 million users in just over two days which directly hit Twitter where it hurts most.   However, if a user is paying Twitter for the verification, then the limit of tweets in a day is 6000.   Another bad move Elon made on Twitter is that he set a limit for the tweets to unpaid and paid accounts. If you are not paying Twitter for the verification then you can only read 600 tweets in a day.
