After the launch of Threads, Twitter saw a downfall in the users as the Meta’s new microblogging platform attracted Twitter’s users. One of many reasons why people joined Threads is that, when Elon Musk took the charge on Twitter, he made some changes like removing Legacy verification which directly attacked the genuineness of Twitter. Unfortunately, you cannot do that because Threads doesn’t give you an option to embed threads links.   Meta’s new microblogging platform, Threads has been a big hit all over the globe, having 100 million users in over two days. But just like that variation, Twitter has some features that Threads doesn’t have which can be an annoying thing for a user.
