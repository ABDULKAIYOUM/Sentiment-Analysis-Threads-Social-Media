The firm’s senior analyst Abe Yousef said that the app has been in the overall top 20 charts of the iOS app store in the Netherlands, Germany, France, Spain and Italy.   The app was in the top charts in the social media category in countries like Germany, France, Spain, Sweden and the Netherlands before Apple removed it from the App Store. Today, Apple removed one of the biggest gainers — an app called Threads for Insta developed by SocialKit LTD. There are a few other apps with similar names and functionality floating around on the App Store, but they haven’t appeared in any top charts yet.   Earlier this year, several apps with “ChatGPT” in their name took advantage of OpenAI not having an official ChatGPT app.
