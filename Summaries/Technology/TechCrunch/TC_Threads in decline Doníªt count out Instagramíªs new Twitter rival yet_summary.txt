Launched on July 5 to global markets, excluding the EU, Threads topped 100 million users within days of its arrival — becoming the fastest app to achieve that milestone, ahead of Pokémon GO, according to app intelligence firm data.ai. Across hundreds of other replies, many posted positive messages, calling the app an “opportunity,” better than Twitter, an “inspiration,” “exciting” and more — an indication that Threads is already building a community of fans.   In one thread on Threads (ha), in fact, users rushed to defend the app against the narrative that the app was dead, remarking that people should be more patient and wait for the needed features, and reminding others that even Instagram wasn’t an overnight success.   While Twitter users are already dancing on Threads’ grave, thanks to The WSJ report, the reality is that it’s too early to report on Threads’ week two usage declines and come to the conclusion that Threads is dying. Any new app on the market would be thrilled to see numbers like these, though perhaps Threads should be judged more harshly because it has the advantage of the network effects delivered by the nature of its parent app Instagram and the broader resources of Meta.
