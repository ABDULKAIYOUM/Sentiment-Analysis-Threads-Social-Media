With X no longer making its data easily available, what better way to get equivalent user-generated data than by launching an X clone, especially as changes to the platform under Musk have led it to bleed users, and competitors like BlueSky and Mastodon have failed to fill the void?   Mark Zuckerberg's choice to launch Meta's Threads app stands in stark contrast to Elon Musk’s recent moves to charge for data from X. WHEN META DEBUTED its new Threads feature earlier this month, it was quickly dubbed “the Twitter killer.” In an interview with The New York Times, Reddit CEO Reed Huffman acknowledged that the “Reddit corpus of data is really valuable” for training AI models but that the company didn’t feel the “need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”   Earlier this year, Musk announced that X would begin charging $42,000 a month for its API, pricing out nearly everyone that used it, particularly academics and researchers, for whom data from X was crucial for research into topics like disinformation. In April, he tweeted that Microsoft had “illegally” used data from X to train its AI models (Microsoft is a partner with Meta and OpenAI, which created ChatGPT).
