"Threads reached 100 million sign-ups over the weekend," Zuckerberg wrote in a post Monday on Threads. Meta's Instagram team launched Threads on July 5, and the text-based conversation app, billed as a Twitter rival, quickly caught on. Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, on Monday called the surge of sign-ups on Threads "insane," and promised the team would "make this thing great."   Though the platform has reportedly been in the works since January, the Threads rollout comes on the heels of Twitter owner Elon Musk announcing limits to how many tweets you can read on Twitter per day.
