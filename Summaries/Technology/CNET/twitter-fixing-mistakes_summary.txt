PT published_by=Allisa James title=Twitter tries to fix its latest mistake as Meta readies its Threads launch body=Twitter’s most recent guffaws include setting daily rate limits on tweets and forcing users to be logged in if they want to even view tweets at all. According to former Twitter CEO Elon Musk, Twitter enacted these limits to combat “extreme levels of data scraping & system manipulation.” We’ll see soon if Meta is capable of what other Twitter lookalikes haven’t been able to accomplish yet — actually replacing Twitter as a preferred social media platform. It has all the basic hallmarks of Twitter — like, comment, repost, and share buttons at the bottom of each post — and lets you avoid immediate news feed clutter by letting you transfer your current Instagram follower list. But it seems that with the launch of Meta’s supposed Twitter-killer Threads, Twitter is trying to roll back at least one of those changes.
