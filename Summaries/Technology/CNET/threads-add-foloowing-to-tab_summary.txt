How to access the Following tab on Threads Threads still defaults to the "For You" feed, so to make the Following feed appear or disappear, you need to tap on the home icon on the bottom left of the app or the Threads logo on top. If you have one, launch the Threads app and select the Instagram profile you want to make a Threads account for.   Instagram head Adam Mosseri has promised several other highly prized features are "on the list" for Threads, according to Forbes, including hashtags, increased search functionality, editable posts, full desktop mode and the ability to limit who can reply to your posts. "Threads started rolling out an option for a chronological feed of only people you're following," Zuckerberg posted on his broadcast channel on Instagram.
