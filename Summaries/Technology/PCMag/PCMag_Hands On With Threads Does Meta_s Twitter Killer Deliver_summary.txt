A fellow PCMagger did not follow her Instagram follows on Threads and her Threads feed populated with posts from random celebs and other accounts she didn't follow on Instagram.   Currently, you can only view a Thread in a web browser from a link (like this from Instagram head Adam Mosseri(Opens in a new window)), though it seems that web access is in the works, The Verge reports(Opens in a new window), likely at Threads.net(Opens in a new window).   Or, open the Instagram app, tap the avatar icon on the bottom right, select the hamburger menu on the top right and tap Threads, which will redirect you to your phone's app store.   Instagram Threads, the new Twitter-like social network from Meta, has a major advantage over its rivals thanks to a built-in audience of more than 2 billion Instagram users. It will take time to see how this works out, but I was pleased with the Threads in my feed, all of which were from Instagram accounts I follow.
