Threads’ daily active users for the Android app fell to 12.6 million on Sunday, according(Opens in a new window) to SimilarWeb, an internet traffic tracker. At the end of last week, Threads had 12.6 million daily active users on Android, or about 12% of Twitter’s audience, according to SimilarWeb.   “US Android users spent nearly 21 minutes per day on the app immediately after launch, but over the past week they’ve spent less than 5 minutes per day with it. However, the developers of Threads will need to fill in missing features and add some new and unique ones if they want to make checking the app a daily habit for users.”   In contrast, Twitter users consistently engaged with the app for about 25 minutes per day,” SimilarWeb said in the report.
