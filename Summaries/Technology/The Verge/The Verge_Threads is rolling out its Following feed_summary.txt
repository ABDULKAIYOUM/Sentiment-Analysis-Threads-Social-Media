A Monday update promised new features in Threads, and the Following feed appears to be one of those additions; some, including a few of us here at The Verge, reported seeing the Following tab on the iOS and Android versions of the app Tuesday morning.   Annoyingly, if you reopen the app after it fully shuts down, it reverts to the “For You” feed, meaning you’ll have to know where to look to bring the Following feed up again — whether that’s a bug or not remains to be seen.   “Ask and you shall receive,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a post on Threads quoting a user asking for the feature.   One of Instagram Threads’ most requested features is finally here: the Following tab that lets you see only the people you, er, follow. Threads launched with a very barebones set of features, and until now, your feed was filled exclusively with algorithm-determined posts from users and brands, whether you wanted it to be or not.
