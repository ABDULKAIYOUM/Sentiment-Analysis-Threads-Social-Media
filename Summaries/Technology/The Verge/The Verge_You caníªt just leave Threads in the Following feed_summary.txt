Once you see it, you can switch between “Following,” which shows posts in reverse-chronological order, and “For You,” which is the algorithmically sorted feed the app has offered since launch.   The brand-new Following feed in Meta’s Threads won’t always stick around if it’s your preferred way to use the app.   But a few of us at The Verge noticed that Threads will occasionally rehide the Following feed and bring you back to the For You feed after you open the app. “For You is the default experience when you open the Threads app,” Meta spokesperson Seine Kim tells The Verge. Having no way to make Following the default is a particularly annoying decision if you want to regularly use the app to get caught up on the latest news.
