Plus, apparently everyone on these new platforms is out to be an iconoclast, so on Bluesky they’re called “skeets” and Mastodon called them “toots” for years. In the early hours of Threads being open to the general public, people tried on “threet” and “tit” for size, as well as a whole slew of textile-related puns. In the early days of Twitter, they were just called “posts” or “updates.” A number of people have been drawn to the word “post,” and post is a very accurate term. I say “duress” because anyone racing to adopt a new social media platform and quickly name its products could probably be doing better.
