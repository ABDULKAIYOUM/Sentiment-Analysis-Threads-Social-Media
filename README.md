The main goal is to compare the sentiment scores from the original raw articles with those from the summarized versions to understand how summarization affects perceived sentiment across different media categories.
Project Overview

This project analyzes the sentiment of newspaper articles covering the launch of the new social media platform **Threads**. Articles were collected and categorized into three media segments:

- **Mainstream Media**
- **Lifestyle Media**
- **Technology Media**

The analysis consists of two main parts:
1. **Sentiment analysis on the original articles**, including merging all articles in each category.
2. **Summarization of each article followed by sentiment analysis on the summaries**.

The goal is to compare sentiment differences between the full articles and their summaries across different media categories.
